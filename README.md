# Gram Panchayat Adoption Advisor

An android application was made to solve the problem of adopting under developed gram panchayats in the country. Exploratory geospatial, census data analysis was done to understand the trends and correlations between different scoring parameters. All this was done using Python and dependencies like Numpy, Pandas, Geopandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.

KMeans clustering algorithm was used to group the gram panchayats similar in their problems. Labels were then assigned to the users who adopted them. The users who adopted villages with same labels were put in 'Similar Interest Groups'. In this way, the adopters can help each other since they are working on similar kinds of problems.

The project was made as a result of the Smart India Hackathon 2018 Grand Finale under ISRO.
